## Situation ##
Eniac, a Spanish electronics retailer specializing in Apple products, was considering a market entry into Brazil. They were approached by Magist, a Brazilian marketplace platform, which offered to manage their supply chain, market entry, and bureaucracy. However, Eniac had concerns about Magist's ability to effectively sell high-end tech products and deliver them on time at competitive prices.

To address these concerns, a thorough data analysis was needed to evaluate Magist's sales performance, delivery times, and overall capability to handle Eniac's product line.

## Action ##
A comprehensive analysis was conducted using the following resources:

- Data Extraction Scripts: Scripts were developed to extract data from the sample dataset provided by Magist and load it into a MySQL database.
- SQL Analysis Queries: These queries were used to analyze sales performance, delivery times, and other relevant metrics to assess Magist's capabilities.
- Tableau Visualizations: Dashboards and visualizations were created to present key findings from the SQL analysis in a clear and informative manner.
- Business Presentation: A document summarizing the analysis and visualizations was prepared for a clear and concise presentation to Eniac's CEO.

## Result ##
This data-driven analysis empowered Eniac to make an informed decision regarding the potential partnership with Magist, addressing their concerns about Magist's ability to sell high-end tech products effectively and deliver them on time at competitive prices.
